# OpenPrint3D Code of Conduct

OpenPrint3D is an open, collaborative effort to define shared standards that
benefit the entire 3D printing ecosystem. To achieve this, our community must
remain respectful, constructive, and neutral — even in the face of disagreement,
criticism, or resistance from individuals or organizations.

This Code of Conduct applies to all contributors, maintainers, and participants
in all OpenPrint3D venues, including GitHub repositories, issue trackers,
pull requests, documentation, discussions, social media, and any official
community spaces.

## Our Standards

### We commit to:

- **Treating everyone with respect and professionalism.**
- **Engaging in good faith**, assuming others are also working with positive
  intentions unless clearly demonstrated otherwise.
- **Providing constructive feedback**, not personal attacks.
- **Focusing on technical issues**, not individuals or organizations.
- **Actively fostering a welcoming environment** for people of all backgrounds,
  experience levels, and viewpoints.
- **Maintaining neutrality** as representatives of the project, especially when
  interacting with outside parties or companies.

### We do **not** tolerate:

- Harassment, insults, or demeaning comments.
- Discriminatory language or behavior.
- Public call-outs, shaming, or inflammatory statements about individuals or
  organizations — **even when those parties are hostile, dismissive, or
  resistant to the goals of OpenPrint3D**.
- Using project platforms (GitHub, forums, social media, etc.) to escalate
  conflicts.
- Misrepresenting personal opinions as official project positions.

## Neutrality and Professional Conduct

Because OpenPrint3D’s legitimacy depends on broad industry trust, maintainers
are expected to uphold a higher standard of conduct:

- Maintainers must not publicly criticize or single out any person or company
  in relation to OpenPrint3D.
- Disagreements with vendors, competitors, or community members must remain
  professional and factual.
- If an organization resists or opposes OP3D, maintainers must not engage in
  public argument. Instead:
  - Document concerns internally.
  - Bring the issue to project leadership.
  - Respond publicly (if at all) with calm, non-escalatory language.

Maintainers are ambassadors for the project. Their behavior directly impacts
OpenPrint3D’s credibility and adoption.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to:

- All official OpenPrint3D GitHub repositories
- Discussions, issues, and pull requests
- Any project-branded forums, chats, or communication channels
- Any situation in which a maintainer appears to represent the project

---

## Enforcement

Violations may be reported by opening a private issue to the project leadership
or contacting an owner directly.

Actions may include, depending on severity:

- A private warning
- Temporary or permanent removal from the maintainer role
- Temporary or permanent ban from project participation
- Escalation to GitHub Trust & Safety if necessary

Project leadership will act with fairness, discretion, and a focus on restoring
a healthy environment.
