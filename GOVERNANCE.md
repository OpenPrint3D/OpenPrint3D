# OpenPrint3D Governance & Decision Policy

This document defines how decisions are made, how responsibilities and roles are assigned, and what standards of conduct are expected for all contributors to OpenPrint3D.

---

## 1. Introduction & Purpose

OpenPrint3D is an open community effort dedicated to building shared standards for 3D printing materials, printers, and processes. As the project grows, it becomes increasingly important to have clear governance, transparent decision-making, and a welcoming, neutral, professional culture.

Our goals with this governance document:  
- Define roles and permissions clearly.  
- Ensure changes to core standards, Code of Conduct, and governance happen with consent and transparency.  
- Maintain a stable foundation while allowing community participation.  
- Preserve neutrality, professionalism, and respect in all communications and interactions.

## 2. Roles & Permissions

| Role | Purpose / Privileges |
|------|----------------------|
| **Project Lead** | Guides overall project direction, resolves disputes, has final decision-making authority when consensus is unclear, assigns/removes maintainers or provisional maintainers. |
| **Maintainers** | Trusted contributors who review and merge PRs, guide technical direction, manage issues/labels, and take part in governance consensus. |
| **Provisional Maintainers** | Contributors transitioning toward full maintainership — can review, comment, triage, but cannot merge to protected branches or vote on governance changes. |
| **Community Contributors** | Anyone contributing via issues, PRs, comments — encouraged to participate but do not have elevated privileges. |

## 3. Governance Principles

1. **Transparency** — All substantial decisions are proposed and discussed publicly (issues, PRs, or discussions).  
2. **Collaboration** — Input from all community members is welcome. Constructive feedback preferred over adversarial debates.  
3. **Safety & Stability** — Changes affecting core standards, governance, or project-wide policies should be made with deliberation and forethought.  
4. **Neutrality & Professionalism** — As a cross-industry standard, the project must remain neutral, avoid public callouts or hostile language, and represent itself with dignity and respect.

## 4. Proposal & Decision Workflow

### 4.1 What can be proposed

Any contributor may propose changes to:  
- Governance model or roles  
- Project-wide policies (e.g. Code of Conduct)  
- Schema definitions or compatibility expectations  
- Documentation standards or guidelines  
- Other core or structural elements  

Proposals must be submitted as:  
- Proposals may begin as GitHub Issues for discussion. Once a proposal is sufficiently defined, it should be submitted as a Pull Request for review and acceptance under the lazy consensus model.

The proposal must describe:  
- Motivation / problem statement  
- Intended change and impact  
- Backward-compatibility or migration considerations (if applicable)  
- Alternatives considered (if any)  

### 4.2 Decision: Lazy Consensus + Maintainer Approval  

The project uses a **lazy consensus** model:

A proposal is accepted if:  
- It has been open for a **sufficient discussion period** (default: 72 hours), and  
- **No Maintainer voices substantive objections**, and  
- **At least one Maintainer approves**, and  
- **The Project Lead does not veto**  

If no objections are raised, the proposal may be merged after the discussion window.

#### Substantive objections  
Valid reasons for blocking a proposal include:  
- Technical issues or regressions  
- Conflict with project design or mission  
- Ecosystem or backward-compatibility concerns  
- Legal, security, or ethical problems  

Personal or non-technical disagreements are not valid blocking reasons.

### 4.3 Disagreement & Deadlock  

If maintainers disagree:  
1. They attempt to reconcile through discussion and compromise.  
2. Optionally request broader community feedback.  
3. If no consensus emerges, **the Project Lead makes the final decision**.  

### 4.4 Maintainer Promotions & Removals  

- The Project Lead grants or revokes maintainer status.  
- Provisional maintainers may become full maintainers after demonstrating consistent, positive contributions.  
- Maintainers may be demoted or removed for inactivity, misconduct, or breach of trust.

## 5. Code of Conduct & Community Standards

OpenPrint3D values a respectful, constructive, inclusive community. We expect all participants — maintainers, contributors, and community members — to abide by the following:

- Engage with **kindness, professionalism, and respect**.  
- Focus on **technical issues**, not individuals or organizations.  
- Provide **constructive feedback**, not personal attacks.  
- **Avoid public call-outs or inflammatory statements** about people or organizations — even if they oppose or resist OpenPrint3D’s direction.  
- Assume good faith from others; allow space for misunderstandings or differing perspectives.  
- Respect diversity in background, experience, views.  

Violations may include harassment, discriminatory language, demeaning behavior, or misuse of project platforms for personal conflict.  

#### Enforcement  

- Violations can be reported via a private issue or direct message to maintainers or the Project Lead.  
- Consequences may include:  
  - Private warning  
  - Temporary or permanent removal of maintainer privileges or project participation  
  - Escalation to external authorities if required  

The Project Lead will handle enforcement impartially, aiming to restore a healthy community environment.

## 6. Scope of Governance Document  

This governance model applies to:  
- All official OpenPrint3D repositories  
- Issue trackers, pull requests, discussions, documentation, official community channels  
- Any interaction where a maintainer or contributor represents the project  

---

## 7. Future Evolution of Governance  

As OpenPrint3D grows, we may transition to more distributed or formal governance structures, such as:  
- Maintainer votes for major decisions  
- Special Interest Groups (SIGs) for different areas (e.g. materials, printers, docs)  
- A formal steering committee or board  
- A foundation-based governance model  

Until then, this document provides a simple but effective framework to grow sustainably and responsibly.
